Johnsonâ€™s Backyard Garden began in an urban backyard in East Austin by Brent and Beth Johnson. In 2004, the owners began to sell their produce at local Austin Farmers Markets. In 2006, they began a small community supported agriculture operation (CSA) and have recently expanded their practices to multiple other cities. Through this program, they deliver shares and offer community pickup sites. You can also volunteer on the farm for half a day in exchange for a share of veggies! They are USDA organic certified and are available almost every day of the week at various Farmers Markets around Austin and pop up shops. They also sell wholesale to numerous restaurants throughout the area and include recipes on their blog as well as a veggie seasonal chart.
